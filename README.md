# KeepPlaying

A Chrome/Firefox extension that prevents videos, ads, and media from pausing when you switch tabs by blocking the Page Visibility API.

## 🎯 What it does

When you're watching videos on YouTube, ads, or any other media content, they often pause automatically when you switch to another tab. This extension prevents that behavior by blocking the browser's Page Visibility API, keeping your content playing in the background.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Keeps videos and ads playing when switching tabs
- 🚀 Lightweight and fast (runs at document start)
- 🛡️ No permissions required
- 🌐 Works on all websites
- 🔧 Updated for modern browsers (Manifest V3)

## 🔧 Technical Details

This extension works by:
1. Overriding `EventTarget.prototype.addEventListener` to ignore visibility change events
2. Overriding document properties like `visibilityState` and `hidden`
3. Blocking both standard and webkit-prefixed visibility APIs

The extension uses Manifest V3 for Chrome and is compatible with Firefox through WebExtensions API.
